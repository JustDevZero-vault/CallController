Contributing to CallController
===============

You wanna contribute to CallController? I'm happy to hear that.
Let us get you some tips...

### Help others
The best way to start contributing to any open source project is to help other people.
You can answer questions on [Stack Overflow] if you want.
Either find something you already know the answer for, or something you feel interested in and
dig into it a little bit to find the answer.


### Improve the documentation
You don’t feel like hacking on the code, but still wanna help?
Improving the documentation is very valuable as it will help many others.

All the source code is in [`docs/`].


### Fix something that bothers you
Some of your users were crying and yelling about some bug and you have fix it?
You found a bug that really bothers you? It’s more likely it bothers other users too and maybe
it’s not that hard to fix it! Try to find an existing issue. If it does not exist yet, create one.
Look into the code and let others know what solution you are thinking about.
Then, send a pull request and let other contributors to review.

[Here](./making-changes.md) is some more info on how to set up your workspace and send a pull
request.


### Fix something else
You want to contribute some code but not sure where to start? That's cool. Fortunately,
there are many issues labeled as "PR please". These are typically fairly simple issues with
a well-known, waiting just for you...

of all the issues for the repo.
